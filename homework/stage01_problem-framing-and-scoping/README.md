# S&P 500 Short-Term Movement Prediction via Market Data & News Sentiment
**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

## Problem Statement
Equity market volatility creates opportunities and risks for institutional investors. Short-term stock moves are driven by historical price action and fast-changing sentiment from financial news. Manual interpretation is slow and inconsistent, causing missed entries/exits. This project will build a predictive pipeline that integrates OHLCV features with NLP-based news sentiment to forecast next-day direction (up/down) for selected S&P 500 stocks. The output supports faster, more consistent decisions on position sizing and hedging.

## Stakeholder & User
- **Primary stakeholder:** Quant trading desk at a buy-side firm.
- **End users:** Quants and traders executing and monitoring positions.
- **Workflow context:** Predictions generated pre–market open and surfaced in a simple table/dashboard for portfolio adjustments.

## Useful Answer & Decision
- **Type:** Predictive.
- **Metric:** Daily probability of “up” vs “down” next day close relative to today’s close, plus confidence score.
- **Artifact:** CSV table (ticker, prediction, confidence, top features) and a simple chart/table for review.

## Assumptions & Constraints
- Reliable OHLCV data for S&P 500 is available; news headlines/text and sentiment are accessible via an API.
- Latency: end-to-end daily run < 1 hour pre-market.
- Compliance with data licensing; no redistribution of proprietary data.
- Scope limited to liquid S&P 500 names for v1.

## Known Unknowns / Risks
- Sentiment quality/timeliness varies across tickers.
- Market regime shifts cause feature drift; performance may decay.
- Risk of look-ahead bias and data leakage if not carefully controlled.
- Regulatory changes could affect data access.

## Lifecycle Mapping
Goal → Stage → Deliverable
- Clarify decision & metric → Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01) → Scoping paragraph, README, stakeholder memo
- Acquire & clean data → Data Acquisition & Cleaning (Stage 02) → Ingestion notebooks + cleaned datasets in `/data/`
- Build baseline models → Modeling (Stage 03) → Feature engineering + model notebooks in `/notebooks/`
- Operationalize daily run → Deployment (Stage 04) → Scripts in `/src/` + scheduled job; CSV outputs

## Repo Plan
`/data/`, `/src/`, `/notebooks/`, `/docs/`; weekly updates with tagged milestones.

## Appendix: 1–2 Paragraph Scoping Text
The volatility of equity markets challenges buy-side desks that need consistent, timely signals. Short-term moves in S&P 500 components are influenced by historical price dynamics and evolving news sentiment. This project develops a predictive model that fuses OHLCV features with NLP-derived sentiment to forecast next-day direction (up/down). The primary stakeholder is a quant trading desk that will use daily probability scores and feature attributions pre–market to calibrate exposure and hedges. The answer is predictive, delivered as a CSV with ticker-level probabilities and top drivers, ready for integration into execution workflows.
