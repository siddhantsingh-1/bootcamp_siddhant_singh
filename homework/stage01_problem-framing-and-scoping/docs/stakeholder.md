# Stakeholder Memo — S&P 500 Short-Term Movement Prediction

**Audience:** Quant Trading Desk  
**Decision:** Adjust pre-market exposure based on next-day up/down probability.  
**Pain Points:** Manual scanning of headlines + charts is slow, inconsistent, and biased.  
**Proposed Artifact (daily by 8:30am ET):**
- CSV table: Ticker | Up_Prob | Down_Prob | Confidence | Top_Features
- 20–50 names with highest confidence and adequate liquidity.
**Guardrails:** No look-ahead leakage; rolling validation; weekly monitoring of calibration and hit-rate.
**Success Criteria (Stage 01 view):** Clear metric definition; stakeholder-approved output schema; feasibility for <1hr latency.
